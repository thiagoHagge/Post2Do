# Post2Do

This project is a Kanban board that allows you to organize tasks using the popular To-do, Doing, and Done columns. You can also create additional columns, create tasks within each column, add tags, delete tasks, and move tasks between columns using drag and drop functionality. This project was developed as a technical challenge for a job application process and does not have a backend as it was not required (no data is saved). The project demonstrates knowledge of event handling and transition effects for drag and drop functionality.
